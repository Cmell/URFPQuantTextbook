# Introduction

This book is intended to cover *just* enough statistical content to help students in the Undergraduate Research Fellowship Program (URFP) at the Ren√©e Crown Wellness Institute perform analyses of [UPWARD](https://cmell.github.io/UPWARDMasterMethodsBook/) data. This book covers:

- Basic data operations.
- Regression.
- Within-participant analysis of two repeated measures via difference scores and regression.
- Moderation with regression, allowing both continuous and categorical variables.
- Mediation.

Each of these topics has been well-documented in other sources. The approach here will be to provide basic examples of useful skills, but then refer the reader to other links that elaborate and provide more foundation.

## R Help

It is helpful to know about R's built-in documentation system. At any point, you can use the console to access manuals for any R function or dataset. Just type:"
"2","/bin/sh: ---: command not found
"
